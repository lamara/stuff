A simple calculator app made for android. As of the latest update it is fully functional, and now uses a non-horrid
way to parse expressions (lets go binary trees you guys rock). It would be interesting to keep on adding more and
more complex features (exponents, parentheses, maybe even trig functions) to see just how easy or how difficult
it would be to add on new stuff. If anything becomes too difficult to implement then that would be a good way to see
what failed with the calculator's overall design and what could possibly be done to improve it if I were to start
over again.
