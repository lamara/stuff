A simple calculator app made for android. For the most part it is fully functional (there is one bug involving
 the input of multiple dots "." that I haven't had time to fix yet, and I haven't set an upper bound on number of
 inputs which is definitely a problem). The calculator will follow order of operations thanks to the calculator class
that I built for it. I have tried to break the app in every way possible but I think it is pretty much good except
for the two issues above.
